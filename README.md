Cyberattacks on ACC and AEB: Adversary Models and Countermeasures

# 1. Content
This repository contains the Simulink models for the fuzzing, reply and DoS attacks. 
Also, we added a Matlab file which contains the attack setup used un our work (the ranges of the attcks foe each signal, the attack probability, etc.).
Additionaly we added the Simulink models for the plasability checks which we developed as countermeasure for our models. 

All models from this repository (.slx file) were saved using Matlab 2021a.

More details will be added on this repository page after out work will be published. 

# 4. Contact
For any questions about our work and models, don't hesitate to contact us (adriana.berdich at aut.upt.ro or bogdan.groza at aut.upt.ro).
